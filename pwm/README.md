# Using PWM
Pulse Width Modulation signals are handy when you want to control motors or dim a led. Instead of using a DC voltage we switch the power on and off. The duration when the power is on is called pulse width. Depending on how long the power is in on against itâ€™s off time we can control how much power a circuit will have.

Connect our LED to the Arduino.

We will use PWM pin on the Arduino and analogWrite() to set different duty cycles (from 0-255 where 0 is off and 255 is on).

50% Duty cycle by writing 128 to the PWM output

25% Duty cycle by writing 64 to the PWM output

12% Duty cycle by writing 32 to the PWM output
